With my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar and my experience as a Software Engineer 2 at Coinbase and Flock (Directi), I believe I am well-suited for this role.\n\nAt Coinbase, I was the tech lead for Finhub asset addition improvements, reducing the engineering time to Finhub addition for new blockchains from 3 weeks to 1 week and new tokens from 1 week to 2 days. This had a significant impact on Coinbase's revenue, as newly listed assets contributed to more than 100 MM USD. I was also the tech lead for Coinbase assets Japan launch, making changes to Coinbase's internal systems to meet Japan's regulatory compliance policies.\n\nAt Flock (Directi), I owned some internal microservices, worked on Titan's Partner panel, and developed features for Flock-Messenger and TitanMail app. I also worked on improving ad click-through rate at Media.Net (Directi), leading to 8% CTR increase on test data.\n\nI have also worked on several projects, such as MyCity: PhotoSharing App, parts of blockchain, Face Movement Generation, and Natural Question Answering Using Bert.\n\nI am confident that my education and experience make me an ideal candidate for this position.
